# Questions Router Cleanup Summary

## Issue Resolved
Removed duplicate questions router file to ensure only one `questions.py` is used across the backend/API server.

## Files Involved
- ✅ **Kept**: `app/routers/questions.py` - The current working version with all fixes
- ❌ **Removed**: `app/routers/questions_fixed.py` - Duplicate backup file

## Comparison Results
The removed `questions_fixed.py` file was missing the important fix for the `modified` field in the Question model instantiation. The current `questions.py` file includes this critical fix:

```python
modified=question_data.get("modified", question_data["asked"]),  # Use asked date as modified if not present
```

## Current State
- **Single questions router**: Only `app/routers/questions.py` exists
- **All 7 endpoints working**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE operations
- **No compilation errors**: Clean code with proper imports
- **Server integration verified**: FastAPI application starts successfully
- **Cache cleaned**: Removed any cached bytecode files

## Router Structure (Final)
```
app/routers/
├── __init__.py
├── answers.py
├── questions.py      ← Single, working questions router
├── search.py
├── tags.py
└── users.py
```

## Verification
✅ **Router imports successfully**: 7 routes registered  
✅ **Main application works**: No import errors  
✅ **Server starts correctly**: FastAPI runs without issues  
✅ **All endpoints functional**: Questions CRUD, search, and voting work  

## Impact
- Eliminated confusion from duplicate files
- Ensured consistent use of the working questions router
- Maintained all functionality while cleaning up the codebase
- Ready for production deployment with clean file structure

The backend now has a single, well-tested questions router that handles all question-related API endpoints correctly.
